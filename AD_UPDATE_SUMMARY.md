## 🎯 Configuration

Current settings in `/config/ads.ts`:

```typescript
export const adConfig = {
  skipDelay: 6,           // Seconds before claim button appears
  trackViews: true,       // Track ad views on server
  minViewDuration: 3,     // Minimum seconds for valid view
};
```

**Recommended values:**
- `skipDelay`: 5-8 seconds (too short = users don't watch, too long = frustrating)
- `minViewDuration`: 3-5 seconds (minimum engagement)
